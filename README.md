# LiLaC

LiLaC is a library mod providing two functionalities:

* Common code for OptiGUI and my future mods
* Provide a unified API across incompatible Minecraft versions

## Why this name?

* **Li**b - obviously this is a library
* **La**pis - a random Minecraft-related word so I get LiLaC
* **C**ore/**C**ommon - reusable code

## Documentation

LiLaC documentation is available at https://opekope2.github.io/LiLaC.
You can see the available APIs on the website.
